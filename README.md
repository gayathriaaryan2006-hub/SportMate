*This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application - there are no build steps required.

How it works:

Open directly: Simply open index.html in any modern web browser
No build tools: No compilation, bundlers, or dependencies needed
No server required: Runs entirely client-side in the browser
Technology stack:

HTML: Structure and form inputs
CSS: Embedded styles with animations, gradients, responsive design
JavaScript: Embedded logic for state management, quiz flow, matching algorithm
To use:

Double-click index.html or drag it into a browser
Works offline after loading
All data persists only during the session (stored in JavaScript object currentUser)*

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
